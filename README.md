# Student Scholarship System
## Intro to Software Engineering Project

Team project completed for an introductory software engineering course to explore software development methodologies from design through to testing in a team environment. A desktop application for the hypothetical management of student scholarships was developed using JavaFX and FXML, an XML-based language provided by JavaFX for building UIs independent of the application logic. The application architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. 

To run:
Load the project into Eclipse
Run as a Java Application (from Main.java)
